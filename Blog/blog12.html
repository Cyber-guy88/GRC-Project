            <p>Corporate governance alongside Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) plays a crucial role in making sure businesses are transparent, accountable, and operate sustainably. Integrating solid governance principles with GRC practices helps businesses gain trust, manage risks, and meet regulatory requirements. This guide aims to explain corporate governance, its connection to GRC, and best practices for management.</p>

            <h2>1. Understanding Corporate Governance</h2>

            <p>Corporate governance consists of the rules and processes that direct a company's operations and decision-making. Effective governance ensures businesses conduct themselves with integrity, responsibility, and in accordance with laws. Key principles include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Ensuring company leaders are answerable to stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clearly sharing timely financial and operational information.</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Equitably treating all shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Adhering to ethical practices and social responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Identifying and mitigating risks affecting business stability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. The Role of GRC in Corporate Governance</h2>
